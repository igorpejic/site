# Tools I enjoy

> Tools amplify your talent. The better your tools, and the better you know how to use them, the more productive you can be.

From: _The Pragmatic Programmer_ by Andy Hunt

Many years of professional software engineering have led to my opinionated list of tools and their configurations that are a daily driver to get things done.

## My Toolset

If I had to describe my toolset it would be:
- keyboard-oriented (see this [blog](https://www.codementor.io/@igorpejic/it-s-time-to-stop-using-the-mouse-hg895pcbh) for the **why**)
- Vim-centric (i.e. avoiding using arrow keys)
- terminal-heavy (preference in using "text" instead of GUI)
- Linux-based (Ubuntu usually)
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/)-dependent (for windows management)

## My Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs usually stored in the `home` directory of the current user.
In Linux, hidden files are identified with a leading dot (`.`). Since the configuration files are usually hidden, they are nicknamed "dotfiles".
